# CZA

CZA is a fast PvP trading card game built for short attention spans and instant feedback.
Matches last ~30 seconds and focus on simple choices, not complex deck-building.

Players choose champions (Cowboy, Zombie, Alien), enter the arena, and compete in real-time.
Rewards are earned through gameplay. Crypto is optional.
